# Phase-4-Wk2-code-challenge

This repository contains the  code challenge for Phase 4, Week 2 - Pizza Restaurants.


## Project Description

### Flask Code Challenge - Pizza Restaurants

For this assessment, I'll be working with a Pizza Restaurant domain.

The job is to to come up with a fully built React frontend application, so that I can test if my API is working.

I will also build out the Flask API to add the functionality described in the deliverables below.

### Models

You need to create the following relationships:

- A `Restaurant` has many `Pizza`s through `RestaurantPizza`.
- A `Pizza` has many `Restaurant`s through `RestaurantPizza`.
- A `RestaurantPizza` belongs to a `Restaurant` and belongs to a `Pizza`.

### Validations

Add validations to the `RestaurantPizza` model:

- must have a `price` between 1 and 30.

### Routes

Set up the following routes. Make sure to return JSON data in the format specified along with the appropriate HTTP verb.

#### GET /restaurants:

Return JSON data in the format below:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sottocasa NYC",
    "address": "298 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11201"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "PizzArte",
    "address": "69 W 55th St, New York, NY 10019"
  }
]
```

#### GET /restaurants/:id:

If the `Restaurant` exists, return JSON data in the format below:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Sottocasa NYC",
  "address": "298 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11201",
  "pizzas": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Cheese",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Pepperoni",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `Restaurant` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

#### DELETE /restaurants/:id:

If the `Restaurant` exists, it should be removed from the database, along with any `RestaurantPizza`s that are associated with it (a `RestaurantPizza` belongs to a `Restaurant`, so you need to delete the `RestaurantPizza`s before the `Restaurant` can be deleted).

After deleting the `Restaurant`, return an _empty_ response body, along with the appropriate HTTP status code.

If the `Restaurant` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

#### GET /pizzas:

Return JSON data in the format below:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Cheese",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Pepperoni",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
  }
]
```

#### POST /restaurant_pizzas:

This route should create a new `RestaurantPizza` that is associated with an existing `Pizza` and `Restaurant`. It should accept an object with the following properties in the body of the request:

```json
{
  "price": 5,
  "pizza_id": 1,
  "restaurant_id": 3
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is created successfully, send back a response with the data related to the `Pizza`:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Cheese",
  "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is **not** created successfully, return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone the repository to any desired folder in your computer.
2. Open the folder with Visual Studio Code or any editor of your choice.
3. There are two folders in the root directory, the `server` folder and the `client` folder.
4. To download the dependencies for the frontend run:

## To run the client

```sh
cd client 
```
 
```sh
npm install 
```
5. To download the dependencies for the backend, run:

```sh
npm start
```
## To run the server

```sh
cd server 
```

```sh
pipenv install && pipenv shell 
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by navigating to the `back-end` folder and run:

```sh
python3 app.py
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) using a separate terminal by navigating to the `front-end` folder and run:



6. And your application is up and running successfully.
